AdCellerant Front End Code Challenge
------------------------------------

Hello!

Thank you for your interest in the AdCellerant engineering team! This is an open ended challenge
giving you full creative license to do as you please. We have set up for you a very simple node
server serving up some JSON at `localhost:3000/data`. Your task is display this data in an interesting
and efficient way using whichever technology you're comfortable with. We're looking for fluency in javascript,
appropriate use of markup, and responsive styling. When you've completed this challenge create a pull request,
update the README on how to get your submission running, and our engineering team will review it.


Bonus Points for:

- Tests
- Interactive Charts
- React/Angular 

Instructions For Install
